# 📸 LensCraft – A Stylish Portfolio Template for Photographers

**LensCraft** is a frontend-only CSS-based website design created especially for **photographers and visual artists** to showcase their work in a sleek and modern layout.

The template includes beautifully styled sections like:

- 🎨 **Gallery** – to display photographs or artwork  
- 🗓️ **Events** – for upcoming shoots, meetups, or photography workshops  
- 🛍️ **Stores & Exhibitions** – to highlight merchandise or showcase ongoing/exclusive exhibits  
- 💬 **Feedback** – where visitors can leave testimonials or suggestions  
- 📞 **Contact** – to share communication details for inquiries or collaborations

While it's currently a **static design** (without functional buttons or navigation), it serves as a solid foundation that can be integrated with backend technologies to build a full-fledged, interactive website in the future.
