# 📸 LensCraft – A Stylish Portfolio Template for Photographers

**LensCraft** is a **frontend-only CSS-based website design** created especially for **photographers and visual artists** to showcase their work in a sleek and modern layout.

The template includes beautifully styled sections like:

- 🎨 **Gallery** – to display photographs or artwork  
- 🗓️ **Events** – for upcoming shoots, meetups, or photography workshops  
- 🛍️ **Stores & Exhibitions** – to highlight merchandise or showcase ongoing/exclusive exhibits  
- 📬 **Contact** – a simple section for sharing contact details  
- 📝 **Feedback** – for collecting responses or testimonials

> ⚠️ This is currently a **static design** (no working buttons or navigation). It’s a solid foundation that can later be enhanced using backend technologies to build a fully functional, interactive website.
